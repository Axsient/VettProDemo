,,,
,,,
,,,
Category,Feature Name,Detailed Line-by-Line Functionality,
Platform Architecture & Core Technology,Secure API-First Backend (Next.js),"The system is built on Next.js API Routes, creating a secure backend layer.",
,,The frontend (React) communicates exclusively with these internal API routes.,
,,Direct database or external service access from the client-side is strictly prohibited.,
,Centralized Database (Postgres + Prisma),Utilizes a single Postgres database as the ultimate source of truth for all application data.,
,,"Employs Prisma ORM for type-safe, secure, and efficient database queries from the Next.js backend.",
,Data & AI Orchestration Engine (n8n),"n8n acts as the dedicated, isolated engine for all external communications.",
,,"Manages automated workflows for pulling supplier data from client ERPs (e.g., Coupa).",
,,"Initiates vetting requests by securely calling external provider APIs (e.g., MIE).",
,,Receives vetting results and writes them to the Postgres database for processing.,
,,"Triggers AI/LLM analysis workflows based on database events (e.g., new report received).",
,High Availability (HA) Infrastructure,Deploys application servers in an Active-Passive configuration behind a load balancer for seamless failover.,
,,"Utilizes a managed, replicated Postgres database service (e.g., AWS RDS Multi-AZ) for automated, instantaneous database failover with zero data loss.",
,Disaster Recovery (DR) Strategy,"Maintains a full, hot-site replica of the application and database in a separate, in-country data center.",
,,"Implements Point-in-Time Recovery (PITR) for the database, allowing restoration to any specific second to neutralize data corruption or ransomware events.",
Security & Compliance,End-to-End Data Encryption,"Enforces TLS 1.2+ for all data in transit between the user, the application, and all external APIs.",
,,Implements AES-256 bit encryption for all sensitive data at rest within the Postgres database.,
,Granular Role-Based Access Control (RBAC),"An ""Administration"" module allows a Super Admin to create and define custom user roles (e.g., ""Finance,"" ""Vetting Officer,"" ""Field Agent Manager"").",
,,"Each feature/action in the application is a distinct permission that can be assigned to a role (e.g., can_initiate_vetting, can_view_pricing, can_approve_invoice).",
,,"Users are assigned roles, inheriting the specific permissions of that role.",
,Comprehensive Audit Logging,"Logs every user authentication attempt (success and failure), including IP address and timestamp.",
,,"Logs all read/write operations on critical data entities (e.g., who viewed a report, who changed a supplier's status) to comply with POPIA.",
,,Logs every external API call made by the n8n orchestration engine for full traceability.,
,Strict Password Policy,"Enforces minimum password complexity (e.g., length, uppercase, lowercase, number, symbol).",
,,"Mandates password expiration every 6 months, forcing users to set a new password.",
,,Implements an account lockout mechanism after a configurable number of failed login attempts.,
,Automated Session Management,"Implements a configurable idle session timeout, automatically logging out users after a period of inactivity to prevent unauthorized access.",
User & Notification System,In-App Notification Center,Features a bell icon in the main UI header that displays a real-time badge for unread notifications.,
,,"Clicking the bell icon opens a dropdown list of recent, categorized notifications (e.g., ""Alert,"" ""Task Assigned,"" ""Report Ready"").",
,Configurable Notification Engine,An admin panel allows configuration of notification rules.,
,,"For each event type (e.g., ""Critical Risk Flagged""), admins can assign specific user roles, groups, or individual users to receive the notification.",
,,"Admins can configure the delivery channel for each notification rule (In-App, Email, SMS).",
Data Management & Export,Universal Table Export,"Every main data table in the application (e.g., Active Cases, Completed Reports, Invoices) features an ""Export to CSV/Excel"" button.",
,,"The export function respects any active filters applied to the table, ensuring the user exports exactly what they see.",
,,"The exported data contains all relevant text and numerical data, excluding images or complex objects.",
,Dynamic PDF Report Generation,"The system can generate professional, multi-page PDF documents on-demand for completed vetting reports and interim case summaries.",
,,"PDFs are dynamically generated from the data, including text, tables, and charts, and are branded with the VETTPRO (or client's white-label) logo.",
